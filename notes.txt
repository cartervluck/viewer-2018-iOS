1. rename the project to the correct year???
2. add a .gitignore? Without one you are commiting a bunch of xcode files and .DS_Store files that just get in the way
3. You have compiler warnings (9 of them!). The 2 deprecation notices are understandable, but all the others look a bit scary
4. You have some entirely empty Model.xcdatamodeld? DELETE SHIT YOU DON'T NEED!
5. The storyboard file is huge. I highly recommend looking at using Storyboard References.  You can split your Storyboard up into multiple separate Storyboards, and then instead of having a push transition go to a view controller, it would go to a storyboard reference to some other file. You still get the benefit of having a combined storyboard and having the flow that way, but without having a huge file.
6. In the storyboard all the images render weirdly big.  This is likely because you are using Asset Catalogs really weirdly.  For example, with "cache" the 1x and 2x and 3x are all the same image OF THE SAME SIZE. This is the opposite of what asset catalogs should do.
